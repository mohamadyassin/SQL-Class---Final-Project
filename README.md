# SQL-Class---Final-Project

This file includes my final project for SQL class at UCSD in summer 2020. I recieved an "A" in the class but I can't remember if I got all answers right in the project. This is why I provided the instructor's solution as a file and branch. It's also a good idea to compare solutions. Please enjoy


I included the dataset so you can practice if you're new to SQL :)
